# Plants
A simple gardening web app made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. To play, open index.html or visit dnalhg.github.io/plants

The game involves tending to a plot of flowers by planting, watering and harvesting the flowers. It was a good experience for me to learn the basics of HTML, CSS and website design.

## Further work
To improve the game experience more features may be added in the future. This includes:
- More plant variety
- Time based stamina recharge and day reset
- A use for the harvested flowers such as serving customers potions for money
